# Model Training

Open the notebook in the folder `web_application/detector-api/[Model Generation] credit-card-fraud-detection.ipynb` and Run all cells, also make sure that all training and test files are save in the correct paths.

This notebook will create two files once done, a `LabelEncoder` and `XGBoostModel` which will later be loaded by the `detector-api` web based project.
